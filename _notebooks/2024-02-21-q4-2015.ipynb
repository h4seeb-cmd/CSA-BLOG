I wrote a constructor for range, which initialized a minumum value and a maximum value. These minimum and maximum values are the bounds for the range of numbers outputed. For example, if the minimum was 5 and the maximum was 10, the range of numbers outputted would be 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The contains method just needs to check whether or not the value given via parameter is in between or equal to the minimum and maximum values. "
