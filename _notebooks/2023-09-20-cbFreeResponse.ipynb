    "The Array/Array Lists FRQ asks the student to write program code to create objects of a class and call methods. It also asks the students to write program code to satisfy method specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements. CollegeBoard provides the student with a ReviewAnalysis class, and I had to write code for two methods inside said class. In part A, I had to write code for a loop that accessed each element of the array instance variable allReviews and returned the calculated average of all the return values of the method getRating. I had to declare and initialize a variable to hold the sum of all ratings. Inside the loop, I had to call the method getRating on all Review elements in allReviews, accumulating a total of the ratings. In part B, I had to write an array list to hold string values. "
