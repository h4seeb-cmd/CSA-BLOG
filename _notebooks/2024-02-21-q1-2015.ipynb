    "This part expanded upon the last part, now being expanded to work with 2D Arrays. This one took me a bit longer, but if you think about it, it's pretty much the same thing as the last problem, as instead of iterating through each individual number, you're just iterating through the different arrays while using \"arraySum()\" as defined in part A in order to get the various sums. Then all I had to do is put the values into an array, which just needed me to create a new array, rowSum, and set the given index to the sum of the corresponding array. "
