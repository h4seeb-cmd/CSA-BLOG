    "# Question\n",
    "Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the| hidden word. After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint."

    "This question took me a long time and was quite challenging for a variety of different reasons. For one, I kept on trying to set hint as a string with no value, like secretWord, but I kept on getting errors, as hint isn't inputted as a parameter, but rather a string which is added to, as seen in the for loop below. I had a couple of mistakes on anatomy too, as I would miss small things like the brackets next to \"args\" in the main tester method. I was also struggling with isolating the characters, so I did have to research to find the charAt() method used. This method works to essentially index a string, allowing programmers to work with a specific character in a string, which was infinitely helpful here. Overall, I need to perfect my knowledge of Java anatomy, as that was a big thing here, and I need to do more research on various different methods that may be useful. "
