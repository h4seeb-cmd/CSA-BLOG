Therefore, result [3] is assigned the value 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Topic:\n",
    "- This question is a test of your knowledge of traversing 2D arrays.\n",
    "- Traversing a 2D array involves visiting each element of the array in a systematic way, usually using nested loops to iterate over both rows and columns. The process ensures that you access and perform operations on every element within the 2D array.\n",
    "- In this example, The first set of nested for loops sets each element in board to “O”. The next for loop starts val at 0 and increments by 1 until val is 4, when val is 5 the loop terminates. When val is even, board is not updated, so nothing happens when val is 0.\n",
    "- When val is 1, row is assigned 1 and col is assigned 0. The boolean condition in the while loop is true, so board[1][0] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 1 and row is decremented to 0 and board[0][1] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 2 and row is decremented to -1 and the while loop terminates. When val is 2, nothing changes about board. When val is 3, row is assigned 3 and col is assigned 0.\n",
    "- The boolean condition in the while loop is true, so board[3][0] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 1 and row is decremented to 2 and board[2][1] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 2 and row is decremented to 1 and board[1][2] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 3 and row is decremented to 0 and board[0][3] is assigned “X”. Finally, col is incremented to 4 and row is decremented to -1 and the while loop terminates. When val is 4, nothing changes about board.\n",
    "### Answer\n",
    "Option E is correct because it accurately reflects the end product of the board after the code is executed. The code fills the board with “O” initially, and then for each value of val from 0 to 4, it sets diagonal elements starting from the top right corner to “X” for even values of val. When val is odd, no changes are made to the board since the while loop condition fails immediately due to the decrement of col and row before the loop\n",

    "Incorrect. This would be the result if the array results were assigned the products in the opposite order that they are calculated. In other words, for each value of j, the calculated product was assigned to result[result.length – 1 - j]. Correct. In the first iteration of the for loop, j is 0. The value of result[0] is assigned the product of row 1, column 0, which is 1 and row 0, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[0] is assigned the value 1. The second iteration of the for loop, when j is 1, result[1] is assigned the product of row 1, column 1, which is 2, and row 1, column 2, which is 3. Therefore, result[1] is assigned the value 6. The third iteration of the for loop, when j is 2, result[2] is assigned the product of row 1, column 2, which is 3, and row 2, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[2] is assigned the value 3. The final iteration of the for loop, when j is 3, result[3] is assigned the product of row 1, column 3, which is 4, and row 3, column 2, which is 1. Therefore, result[3] is assigned the value 4.\n",

    "Topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is a test of your knowledge of traversing 2D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traversing a 2D array involves visiting each element of the array in a systematic way, usually using nested loops to iterate over both rows and columns. The process ensures that you access and perform operations on every element within the 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, The first set of nested for loops sets each element in board to “O”. The next for loop starts val at 0 and increments by 1 until val is 4, when val is 5 the loop terminates. When val is even, board is not updated, so nothing happens when val is 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When val is 1, row is assigned 1 and col is assigned 0. The boolean condition in the while loop is true, so board[1][0] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 1 and row is decremented to 0 and board[0][1] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 2 and row is decremented to -1 and the while loop terminates. When val is 2, nothing changes about board. When val is 3, row is assigned 3 and col is assigned 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The boolean condition in the while loop is true, so board[3][0] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 1 and row is decremented to 2 and board[2][1] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 2 and row is decremented to 1 and board[1][2] is assigned “X”. Then col is incremented to 3 and row is decremented to 0 and board[0][3] is assigned “X”. Finally, col is incremented to 4 and row is decremented to -1 and the while loop terminates. When val is 4, nothing changes about board.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Option E is correct because it accurately reflects the end product of the board after the code is executed. The code fills the board with “O” initially, and then for each value of val from 0 to 4, it sets diagonal elements starting from the top right corner to “X” for even values of val. When val is odd, no changes are made to the board since the while loop condition fails immediately due to the decrement of col and row before the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popcorn Hack\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a similar example to the code with an intentional mistake for you to solve String[][] board = new String[5][5]; for (int row = 0; row < 5; row++) { for (int col = 0; col < 5; col++) { board[row][col] = “O”; } } for (int val = 0; val < 5; val++) { int row = val; int col = 4; while (col >= 0 && row >= 0) { if (val % 2 == 0) { board[row][col] = “X”; } else { // Intentional mistake: This should be ‘board[row][col] = “O”;’ // Students need to identify and fix this line. board[row][col] = “X”; // Incorrect assignment } col–; row–; } } The mistake is in the else block where it incorrectly assigns “X” instead of “O”. Students should correct this to: board[row][col]=”0”; in order to fix the code. The corrected code will alternate between “X” and “O” on the diagonals for each value of val\n",

    "E: The set method can be used in the System.out.print() method, because it returns the value that was at this index before it was updated to “Alex”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, choice C was correct. This is because the first for loop uses the set method to change the value of each element in students to “Alex”. When the set method is called, it returns the value that was originally at this index. So, the first loop will print Alex Bob Carl. At this point all elements have been set to “Alex”. The second for loop uses an enhanced for loop to access every element and will print Alex Alex Alex.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you got this wrong, I would suggest going back to ArrayList methods and how to traverse an ArrayList through different methods and algorithms. Since this was the student lesson I taught, I didn’t struggle with these questions, and I also know how to help those who might be struggling.\n",
