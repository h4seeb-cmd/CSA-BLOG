This week we plan to work with JavaScript to make web interactions, along with making MortPages suitable for a pull request on the student and/or teacher repositories so that it is usable and easily accessible to all students. 

## Monday: 
- Plan: Work on setting up JavaScript Itunes API system and pulling/accessing songs by API calls. We will also add various themes to MortPages,
- Wednesday: Sign up for live review and apply any finishing touches. Proceed to review at an available date.
- Thursday-Friday: Work on custom MortPages jekyll theme compatibility to prepare and debrief before possible merge.
