# Things We Had to Work On

### Teamwork 
Teamwork and collaboration were something that we definitely had to learn. By pooling together diverse skills, perspectives, and experiences, we were able to tackle planning and the performance more effectively, because something of this magnitude could not have been done with people slacking. The collaboration helped us foster a sense of unity, shared ownership of the tangibles we ccreated, and an overall mutual support among team members, leading to increased productivity, creativity, and morale. Moreover, this activity forcing us to reckon with our interpersonal issues helped us as individuals learn from each other.

### Ego
I noticed that there were teammates who definitely had a problem with ego, and that played into the lack of teamwork and communication at the start of the prep cycle, as they thought they were either:
- Above working on this class
- Above other team members and thus not wanting to work together

# Facets which were affected 

### Script Writing
Here is the script: [script](https://docs.google.com/document/d 1iwAiQPwH11czTb8pWZ7LBYKrwehByTOt-lKfkiWJ6ow/edit)

The script writing process was admittedly rough, with some members refusing to concede and come to a resolution, but with lots of peacemaking, I was able to get both sides to compromise:
- One group wanted to keep the original script, which they worked hard on but was admittedly, too long and self indulgent
- One group wanted to reduce the script to practically nothing, absolving them of the work.

Both sides would fight in class constantly, but after WAY too long, I was able to get them to concede and make a script that both sides were... sorta okay with.

### Planning
Our planning was pretty bad, with us needing to work on actually coordinate and get on our stuff.
