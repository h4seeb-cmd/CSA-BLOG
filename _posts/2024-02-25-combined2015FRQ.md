# Reflection

Overall, this FRQ was very helpful. It helped me figure out my biggest weakness, which is my lack of mastery in the fundamentals of Java anatomy and syntax in general. I constantly would be like "oh, I know how to go about doing this!" but I would fail to actually pinpoint how to write the code for what I thought the solution would be. I would stumble around in VSCode for 30 minutes and continuously question my sanity until I finally figured out how to iterate through rows and columns in a 2D Array. Conceptually, I seem to have a good grasp of what it is I need to do to solve a problem, but in practice, I fail to actually write the code to carry out said solution. To alleviate this, I plan to do lots of practice FRQ questions while also reviewing previous lessons on Java anatomy and concepts.
