# What tools am I talking about?
In APCSA, we are required to use a large variety of different things that help us complete our projects. These are our tools. Some of these tools include:
- VSCode: our Integrated Development Environment (or IDE for short)
- WSL: what helps us access Linux through the Windows command terminal
- JS, Python, and Java Kernels: These kernels help us to work with these languages in our blogs using our <u>Jupyter Notebooks.</u> These kernels also allow us to use the languages in other places as well.
- Jupyter Notebooks: These notebooks help us showcase code while we are blogging. They can also be used to show the step by step process by which a program runs by running each segment cell by cell.
- Markdown: Markdown is a type of markup language that is known for it's easy integration and convenient syntax. Markdown is used throughout this site, and this very page was written in markdown.
- Github: Github is a site that is used by programmers to add their own open source projects that people can view, and the code is compiled in a repository. Github is also used for version control as well. Without Github, and by extension <u>Github Pages</u> nothing here could be possible, and many modern software development innovations would not be here.
- Github Pages: Github Pages is a site hosting service that is integrated with the Github repository system. 

# Why Tools are the GOAT
Without our tools, none of what we do in this class is possible, and it is only with these tools that we can achieve great things.
