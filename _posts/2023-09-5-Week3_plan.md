# MortPages (FastPages Clone) Plans:
## Finished Product/Features For The Week:
- Support for other Jekyll Themes
- Documentation for the project detailing how to switch themes, add styles, clone, things of that nature
- A more polished site

## Path to Achieve Finished Features
### Thursday 8/31: 
- Plan: Work on adding theming to MortPages Blogging Platform
- Outcome/Solution: I figured the most efficient way to add theming support is to overlay other themes on top of the existing minima theme instead of using a remote theme to not interfere with the existing page structure. 

## Friday 9/1: 
- Plan: Add Custom Themes
- Outcome: Addition of the Hacker and Minimal Mistakes theme without major issues in the overall styling. 

## Saturday-Monday 9/2-4:
-  Plan: More Custom Themes + Documentation
- Outcome: Worked on adding the Monophase, Hamilton, and Leaf themes on top of MortPages, with guides on theming needing to workplace with some information being present. 
- Future Plans: Finish documentation and move folders to make theming more simple and easier to manage. 

# JS Hacks Plans: 
## Finished Product/Features For The Week:
- A JS Page that extracts from various APIs using JQuery. One API that displays a random image relating to anime, one API that alters text to be in the "owo" style, and one API that displays a random quote from artist Kanye West. 


## Tuesday 9/5 Plans:
- Plan: Javascript Peer Showcase - Decide on API 
- Outcome: ~~Decided to make a client able to display a variety of home data and information about taxes available for streaming and then format that day into a format via JQuery with a small quote section from famous figures.~~ Decided to create an anime/meme webpage that extracts from various APIs using JQuery. One API that displays a random image relating to anime, one API that alters text to be in the "owo" style, and one API that displays a random quote from artist Kanye West.

## Wednesday 9/6
- Plan: Work on finalizing plans, ~~and also adding more content, ~~ debugging so nothing goes wrong during presentations, and brainstorming possible additional features to be added to the blog. 
- Outcome: ~~Progress is made on researching the amount of max limits and if needed allocations for fees to be paid to use the API if unavoidable. Work on planning procedures for review such as presentation content.~~ Fixed an issue with the anime image API where the images don't show properly, and fixed an issue with the OWO-ify API where it would not display the output in the edited format.

## Thursday 9/7
- Plan: Finish up with the final touches to the JS Hacks webpage's CSS, make it more presentable during presentations. Also finalize the plans and make sure each of us knows what to present to the teacher during presentations.
- Outcome: Work done on finalizing the plan and the page with the JS Hacks now looks ready to present. Final product ready for showcase.  ~~creating the main page for implementation of the API in a blog post and using JQuery to send API requests and format the data into the needed elements while also implementing basic styling to make the page appear more appealing.~~ 

# Friday (Presentation) 9/8
- Plan: Show Mr. Mortenson the following: 
1) JS Hacks, talk about the use of JQuery, what we had to do to implement the APIs, challenges we faced along the way. Highlight the major anime image bug, the Kanye Rest API and how we got TTS, and the difficulties of implementing the OWOify API.
2) MortPages, discuss progress on MortPages, come up with final deadline for pull request (if approved), and talk about the various themes implemented.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to show understanding of JQuery and systems during presentation.
