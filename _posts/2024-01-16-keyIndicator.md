# Mini Project
### Overview:
The mini-project went pretty well, considering my team. I was in charge of the Pallette Puzzle frontend and connection to backend, and overall, it was pretty fun. I learned a lot about hashmaps, as that's what I had to work with. Working with Drew was pretty fun, and I learned a lot about workflow and organizational proccesses from him.

# Student Lessons
### Overview: 
Overall, the student lessons went fairly well. I had issues with focus and punctuality, which I reflected on in my CB Quiz Overview. I feel like the hacks were very long winded and just tedious at times, but the information presented was helpful. The most helpful lesson for me was the JWT lesson, as I see myself using this in the future.
