# Overview
This trimester in Computer Science A, we were introduced to the Java language and got a taste of true OOP. Focus on getting back into the swing of things with AGILE Methodology and OOP.

# What I Learned
This trimester was quite successful for me, in many aspects. Although my grade is not PERFECT, I feel like taking more risks in my learning and work helped teach me so much more than playing it safe for the largest amount of points. Working on something with hardware yet again, but building something from scratch, definetely was an experience. Working with people like Varalu, who is generally more proficient then me in Computer Science and even working with hardware, was very illuminating. I learned a lot from watching and learning from Varalu. 

# Collegeboard MCQ Reflection
I had to use many resources in order to go through this quiz, and it was pretty challenging. I think I need to work with key Java concepts disucessed in lessons some more, I think it would be good to make some mini-projects that directly correlate to those concepts.
