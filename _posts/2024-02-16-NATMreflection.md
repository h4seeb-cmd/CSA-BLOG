## Our Presentation
Overall, the presentation went pretty well, and a lot of people seemed to be interested in our project. However, we did get some constructive criticism on things we could do better.

Glows:
- Good proof of concept, idea of game very good. Simulation, while it could've been more fleshed out for this demo, people had lots of fun planting corn!
- Good presentation style, very approachable. Specialized presentations were a good idea.

Grows:
- Add something in sim screen to show data being updated, too static.
- Need to add more crops than just corn.
- Having the cash working would've been a nice touch.
- UI needed to be cleaned up.

## Elsewhere in CSA
I saw lots of interesting and cool projects other teams built as well, one of my favorites being a Pokemon type game created by Luna's 6 person group.

*The game world being demo-ed to a group of people*
Like us, this group decided to work with the Phaser.js framework/engine, and they did a great job with getting their game world up and cleaned up for the presentation. I have to say, I can't wait to see what they do next!

## Non-CS Projects
My favorite piece outside of class had to be in 2D Studio Art, where someone drew a really nice photo of one of my favorite cars, the Porsche 911. Overall, this clas snever fails to impress me with their output, and their work is always top grade.
