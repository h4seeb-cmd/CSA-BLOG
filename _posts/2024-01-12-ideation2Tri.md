# The Concept:
Our team decided on creating Del Norte CSA, which stands for Del Norte Community Supported Agriculture. It will be an IPM interactive simulation. IPM standing for Irrigated Pest Management, and the idea is that we will have a super interactive simulation where people can test different pest management strategies and observer their outcomes on yeilds without real world consequences. 

We plan to use a pixelated artstyle, and we plan to make it very fleshed out.

# Why we decided on this:
Originally, we had a bunch of different ideas, but we needed something useful, something that would be productive. That's when Tirth ran this idea by us, and the idea of an interactive simulation stuck out to us. We can factor in a bunch of different variables and make this super throurough.

# Logistics
We plan to create a Nighthawk Pages blog site where we will log our progress and talk about our project. We plan to use a spring framework for the backend, in which we will store user data. The frontend will be connected to our team blog site, which will link to an HTML page that will contain all the necessary JS and HTML.
